Just the sha3 method used by Ethereum dApps and contracts.

## Install

```
npm install --save ethjs-sha3
```

## Usage

```js
const sha3 = require('ethjs-sha3');

console.log(sha3('skfjksdfjksdjksd'));

// result 0x2b30820856594159b8ed9a26609193526e944a1a748eb7d493beac83911dd848

console.log(sha3('skfjksdfjksdjksd', true));

// result <Buffer ...> -- a buffer object
```

## About

A sha3 port from the `ethers-wallet`. Just a single sha3 method that returns a hexed 32 byte string by default. It can also be used to result a Buffer if need be.

## Method API

```
sha3 <Function (String|Buffer inputData, Boolean toBuffer) : String|Buffer>
```
